# About:
  - Goal was to create a tool for small businesses to create their own giftcards to improve business.
  - I thought about the idea when I was working at a restaurant and some customers wanted to buy a giftcard, at the time we didn't have a system set up in place to do that so my boss ended up just signing a voucher. I started to think about how small businesses don't have infrastructure in place to create a giftcard system compared to larger corporations. So I started to work on a web application that could empower small businesses.
  - Although there are some issues with the idea as a whole I decided to work on it as a small web development project on the side and use it locally at the restaurant to see how well it works and further improve it.

# Plans for the Future:
  - Programatically create giftcards and codes to be printed.
  - Adapt to a phone application

# How to Set Up:
  - Enter folder directory and npm install
  - Enter your own google-oauth and mongodb api keys into a file called config.env and put that file into the config folder with the following variable names
  - Run NPM dev and enter the application through localhost:3000
